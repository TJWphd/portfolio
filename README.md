# portfolio: TJWphd

This portfolio was created as a homework project for UCB Fullstack Coding Bootcamp.

As with my last homework project (Semantic Refactor), I went fairly methodically through the class activities to see how to code HTML and CSS to display the information as I wanted it, using the mockup animation as a guide.

I wrote the HTML and CSS files from scratch, using class activities as a roadmap and turning to web forums (e.g. W3, Medium) to help with questions along the way.

I did not collaborate with classmates on this assignment.
