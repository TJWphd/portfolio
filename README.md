# portfolio: TJWphd

This portfolio was created as a homework project for UCB Fullstack Coding Bootcamp.

As with my last homework project (Semantic Refactor), I went fairly methodically through the class activities to see how to code HTML and CSS to display the information as I wanted it, using the mockup animation as a guide.

I wrote the HTML and CSS files from scratch, using class activities as a roadmap and turning to web forums (e.g. W3, Medium) to help with questions along the way.

I did not collaborate with classmates on this assignment.

<!-- // semantic elements can be called without . or #
// hashtag is for id, period is for class
// images called differently in HTML vs CSS
// command forward slash to comment out in Mac
// HTML tags are only in HTML duh, CSS uses classes -->
<!-- can open w live server now, right click and select -->
