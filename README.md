# portfolio: TJWphd

## description

My portfolio highlights my professional experiences attractively in one place. The portfolio is first and foremost the most important part of itself.

My portfolio includes a short biography and links to highlight my recent achievements in front-end web development. As my programming skills develop, I will include back-end development and full-stack development projects in my portfolio.

This deployment version (2.0) enhances this README with improved sections, descriptions, credits and acknowledgements; HTML links section now attach correctly to deployed projects; and CSS code is updated with comments.
